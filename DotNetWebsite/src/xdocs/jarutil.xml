	Rana Bhattacharyya designated the source as APL so that we may support it
	as a built in application. It is a WinZip replacement, though a bit simpler
	for now. This is the start of something great. Rana is on the team building other things for Jesktop and just as exitingly Avalon (he's making a FTP server for it).
