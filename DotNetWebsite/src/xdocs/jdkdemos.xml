      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>SwingSet2 Demo.</strong>  This demo is nearly fully compatible with Jesktop.  It's only problems are that it does not have an empty constructor, nor does it have the applications manifest.  These have been overcome with an adapter class supplied with Jesktop. See package org.jesktop.demos.jdksupport.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>JavaSound Demo.</strong>  The same problems as above with the same solution.
