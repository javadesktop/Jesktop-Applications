          <strong>Warped Image Manipulator.</strong>  This image-warping app by Alex Rosen was copied into Jesktop for demonstration purposes.  Porting was relatively simple from applet to Swing panel.  You can visit the <link href="http://www.axlrosen.net/">author's home page</link> for more informations on this app.

          <strong>Julia Set Animation.</strong>  This art app by Robert Olofsson was copied into Jesktop for demonstration purposes.  Porting was relatively simple from applet to Swing panel.  The author will be contacted to determine his intentions for the app.

          <strong>Mondrian Art Thingy.</strong> This art app by Richie Bielak was copied into Jesktop for demonstration purposes.  Porting was relatively simple from applet to Swing panel.  The author will be contacted to determine his intentions for the app.  This tool has repaint bugs, that while interesting, should be fixed in time.  They are a consequence of porting to Swing from AWT rather than a reflection on Richie's work.
