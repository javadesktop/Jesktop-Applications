	Dr.M.L.Noone developed this cool editor and has it's source repository
	under the Giant Java Tree. It is GPL and we took a snapshot at the end
	of November and adapted it to run under Jesktop. It does so very well
	and is a example of an extremely polished application. Well done Dr
	Noone.  We have donated the source changes back to Dr Noone (it still
	runs in standalone mode) and he may, if he chooses, formalize the
	Jesktop compatibility.
