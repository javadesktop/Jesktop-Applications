The following is a list of commands that are to be supported by JSwat.
As each command is implemented, it will be removed from this list.
The list of commands supported by JSwat is available by typing
"help commands" at the JSwat command prompt.

threads [threadgroup]   -- print threads in a thread group

[un]monitor <expr>      -- execute command each time program stops
                           (support more than one monitor; number them)
runto <class id>:<line> -- run to a line in a class (this one is tricky,
                           it must set a breakpoint, then clear it when
                           the breakpoint has been hit)
set <lvalue> = <expr>   -- assign new value to field/var/array element
                           (how to create a Value object?)
list <line>|<method>    -- print source code context at line or method
[un]trace [go|thread] methods <thread>
                        -- watch method entry/exit events
[un]watch [go|thread] access|all <member>
                        -- watch data member access
exclude [<class> ...|none]
                        -- exlude step or method events for given classes
invoke <objref>.<method>(args[,...])
                        -- invoke given method
bytecodes <class>.<method>
                        -- display bytecodes of a method


Not currently able to implement
----------------------------------------------------------------------
kill <thread(group)>    -- kill a thread or threadgroup
                           (need to be able to suspend thread inside VM)
