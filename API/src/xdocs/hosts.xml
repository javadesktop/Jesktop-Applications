    <s1 title="Introduction">
      <p>
        Any OS that can provide a J2SE environment could be a host to Jesktop and Avalon.  That said, there are not many.  Manufacturers of lightweight and RTOSs have a fixation for Personal Java on the KVM.

    <s1 title="Full blown">
      <p>
        Windows and Linux are supported already.
      </p>
    </s1>
    <s1 title="For the Future">
      <p>
        AtheOS, QNX, VxWorks, Elate, (TODO).  It kinda really depends on the availablity of J2SE for those platforms and Ant supporting them.
