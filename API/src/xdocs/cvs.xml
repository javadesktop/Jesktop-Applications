    <s1 title="CVS details">
      <p>
	Our CVS repository is mounted at SourceForge.	
      </p>
      <p>
	See SourceForge's <link href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=43838">page</link> for CVS configuration details.  There are multiple modules.  See <link href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jesktopapps/">page</link> for the module names.  They will all have to be placed relatively next to each other in a directory for building to work.  We use Ant (see below) to build the apps.
      </p>

    <s1 title="A word about Ant">
      <p>
	Jesktop uses Ant for a platform neutral building.  What doesn't nowadays?  It wants to use it's own ant, not the one you may have installed.  <strong>As such it needs two things from you before starting:</strong>
      </p>	
      <ol>
        <li>
          Environmental variable JAVA_HOME set to the correct directory.  Sun describe this in their Java installation procedures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Environmental variable PATH to have JAVA_HOME/bin as one of it's colon or semi colon separated entries.
        </li>
      </ol>
