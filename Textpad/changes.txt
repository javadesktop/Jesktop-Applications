Changes to Textpad upon forking into Jesktop, Nov 29th 2000
Forked by Paul Hammant.  
Repackaged to org.jesktop.textpad, but will hapily give back 
changes to Dr M.L.Noone and surrender fork back to the GJT 
if jesktop compatability continued.
============================================================
