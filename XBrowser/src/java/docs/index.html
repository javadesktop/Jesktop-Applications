<h3>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
XBrowser is totally free java application for browsing the web. It will
execute on any OS supporting Java 2 platform. It is fully multithreaded and
it means that you can open several web pages simultaneously in one session.
It is customizable, providing options for changing the way XBrowser looks
and operates. It provides the basic features that every web browser needs
to support plus much more advanced features such as printing and print
preview, flexible searching among history, bookmarks and page contents,
import/export facility in order to have your bookmarks from other famous
browsers (IE, Netscape and Opera). Auto-Complete and Domain-Completion are
two of the other useful features to reduce your amount of typing and save
your time while surfing the net. All the program configuration as well as
the bookmarks and history are kept in XML format in order to increase the
data portability. It has been internationalized and ready to support more
languages. You can find more details in <a href="#Features">Features
</a> section.
