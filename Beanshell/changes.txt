Changes to Beanshell upon forking into Jesktop (July 2000)
Forked by Paul Hammant.  

1) Repackaging : none 

2) One protected method made public (I forget which!)

3) new java files created, BeanShell.java and Workspaces.java
   copied from bsh scrits of the same name.

If Pat and the beanshell folks, want to continue with Jesktop 
compatibility then they are more than welcome to take back 
the changesm integrate and this fork would dissapear. - PH
